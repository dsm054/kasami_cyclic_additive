# Finite character-sum criteria for bijectivity

Complex-valued characters form a basis of the function space on a finite
abelian group. Consequently, if a self-map preserves the sum of every
character, then it preserves the sum of every complex-valued function. Point
indicators then force surjectivity, hence bijectivity.

For finite fields we also record the multiplicative analogue needed by the
MCM-permutation argument. If a map has zero as its unique zero and preserves
every multiplicative-character sum, restrict it to the unit group and apply the
additive criterion to `Additive Kˣ`.
