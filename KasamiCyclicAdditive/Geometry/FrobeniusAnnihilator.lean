# The Frobenius annihilator on `E(K)`

For a finite field `K` with `|K| = 2^n`, the `n`-th power of the Frobenius
endomorphism is the identity on `E(K)`, simply because every coordinate
satisfies `x^(2^n) = x`.  In even dimension `n = 2j` the CM relation
`π² = [-2]` additionally gives `π^n = [(-2)^j]`, so comparing the two
descriptions shows that

  `nn n = (-2)^j - 1`

annihilates `E(K)`.  That is the hypothesis `hann` of
`Isogeny.gMap_bijective`, and together with `Descent.isCoprime_nn`
it makes `G` bijective on `E(K)` — no algebraic closure and no kernel
decomposition.

/-! ### Inverting `G` on `E(K)` -/

/-- For odd `k = 2r+1` in even dimension, the prime-to-3 factor `G` is a
bijection of `E(K)`, so every point has a `G`-preimage.

The 3-primary obstruction is the separate factor `1 + π`, and `G` is inverted by
Bézout against the annihilator `nn n`, over `K` itself.  The factorization
`(1 + π) ∘ G = 1 + π^k` is `Isogeny.gMap_factor`, applied by the caller where it
is needed. -/
