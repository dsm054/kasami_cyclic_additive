# The geometric input, in slope-free form

`RootEqSolvable` is the bare statement that the twisted root equation is
solvable at *every* affine Fermat target with nonzero coordinates: the
interface universally quantifies over the Fermat target, rather than carrying
a chosen target and cube-root-of-unity pair as external parameters.  The
root-count bound of `Assembly/GeometricChain.lean` uses it directly.

Concretely `w = W ^ 3`, `z = T ^ 3` for a point `(W, T)` of the Fermat cubic, so
`w + z = 1` is the Fermat equation and `w ^ m = W ^ (3m) = W ^ (2^k+1)`; the
equation in the definition below is then exactly the twisted root equation of
`KasamiCyclicAdditive.FermatCubic.exists_twisted_root_equation`.

It lives in its own file so that `Geometry/EvenCase.lean`, which proves
`RootEqSolvable` for even `n`, can be imported *by*
`Assembly/GeometricChain.lean` without an import cycle.
