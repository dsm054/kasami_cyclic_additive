# The even-dimensional root-existence branch: the quotient-first bridge

The quotient-first route to `RootEqSolvable` in even dimension.

**The route.** Let `K = F_{2^n}` with `n` even, target `(p,q)` with `p,q ≠ 0`.

1. `PointFrobenius.exists_gMap_preimage` inverts the prime-to-3 factor `G` on
   `E(K)` directly (no algebraic closure), producing `Y` with
   `G(Y) = t3 - P`.
2. `Y` is not `3`-torsion (since `t3 - P` isn't), so `Y = (x,y)` with `x,y ≠ 0`.
3. Base-change `(x,y)` to `F = AlgebraicClosure K`.
4. Pick any cube root `W` of `(x+1)/(x+y)` in `F` and build `T` as in
   `FermatCubic.explicit_quotient_coordinates`: this gives a point `Q = (W,T)`
   with `Q + π Q = (x,y)_F`, i.e. `Q` is a preimage of `(x,y)_F` under the
   "quotient" map `id + π`.
5. Since `G` and `1 + π` commute (both are polynomials in `π`), and `G`
   transports along the base-change map `basePt K F` (which itself commutes
   with `π`), `(1 + π)(G(Q)) = G(Q + π Q) = G((x,y)_F) = (t3 - P)_F`. Combined
   with the abstract factorization `(1+π) ∘ G = 1 + π^k`
   (`Isogeny.gMap_factor`), this gives `(1 + π^k) Q = t3 - P` over `F`, i.e.
   `phi k W T = P` over `F`.
6. The Frobenius-twist relation `π^n Q = Q + ptInf α` needed by
   `exists_twisted_root_equation` follows from `Q + π Q` being `K`-rational (hence fixed by the
   `n`-th Frobenius power) together with `π^n` commuting with `1 + π`: this
   puts `π^n Q - Q` in `ker(1+π)`, which is exactly the three points at
   infinity (`frobFixed_eq_ptInf`, a small self-contained restatement that
   needs no kernel-split machinery).
7. `exists_twisted_root_equation` gives the ambient twisted-root equation, and since
   `W^3, T^3` were built from `K`-rational data *before* the cube root was
   chosen, they are already `algebraMap`-images of elements of `K` — no
   fixed-field descent theorem is needed.
