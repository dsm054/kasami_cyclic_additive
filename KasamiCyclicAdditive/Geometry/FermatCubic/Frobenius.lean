# Frobenius periodicity

If an element of a field of characteristic two is fixed by `pi^k` and by `pi^n`,
where `pi` is the Frobenius `x -> x^2` and `gcd (k, n) = 1`, then it is fixed by `pi`, hence lies
in the prime field `F_2`.

No algebraic closedness is needed: `x^2 = x` already forces `x = 0` or `x = 1` in any field.
