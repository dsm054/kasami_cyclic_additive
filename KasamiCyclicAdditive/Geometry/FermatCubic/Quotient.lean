# Explicit quotient coordinates on the Fermat cubic

Given an affine point `(x,y)` of `x³ + y³ = 1` with `x, y ≠ 0` and any cube
root `W` of `w = (x+1)/(x+y)`, the point `(W,T)` with `T = r/W`,
`r = (1+x+y)/(x+y)`, lies on the cubic and has Hessian addition coordinates
exactly `(x,y)`.

This is the algebraic content of "`(x,y)` is the image of `(W,T)` under
`Q ↦ Q + πQ`", proved directly from the defining equation: no group law,
Frobenius endomorphism, or algebraic closure is involved.  Note the direction —
`w` and `z` are produced in `K` first, and `W`, `T` are only cube roots
chosen afterwards.

Explicit quotient-coordinate lemma.

Let `K` have characteristic two and let `(x,y)` be a non-3-torsion
affine point of the Fermat cubic

    x^3 + y^3 = 1

with `x,y ≠ 0`.

Suppose `W` is any cube root of `w = (x+1)/(x+y)`, and let `T = quotientT x y W`
be the lift `((1+x+y)/(x+y))/W`.  Then

* `T^3 = (y+1)/(x+y)`,
* hence `W^3+T^3=1`,
* the Hessian denominator for `(W,T)` and `(W^2,T^2)` is nonzero,
* and the Hessian addition coordinates are exactly `(x,y)`:

    hessX(W,T,W²,T²) / hessD(W,T,W²,T²) = x,
    hessY(W,T,W²,T²) / hessD(W,T,W²,T²) = y.

This is the explicit algebraic statement that `(x,y)` is the image of
`(W,T)` under the quotient map represented by `Q ↦ Q + Frobenius(Q)`,
established from the formulas above alone, with no elliptic-curve group law.
