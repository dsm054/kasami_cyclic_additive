# Elementary inputs

Three bookkeeping inputs the assembled theorem needs:

* a primitive additive character `K → ℂ` is supplied by Mathlib
  (`KasamiCyclicAdditive.primitiveAddChar`);
* the exponent inverse `D` is supplied by the extended Euclidean algorithm;
* the admissible-slope finset is nonempty as soon as `|K| > 2`.
