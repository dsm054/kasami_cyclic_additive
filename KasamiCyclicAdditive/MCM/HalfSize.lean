# Half-size of the Kasami derivative image

For odd `k`, `mcmMap k` is globally bijective, hence injective on the
Artin--Schreier image.  Since

`derivativeImage k K = image (mcmMap k) (asSet K)`

and `asSet` has exactly half the elements of `K`, the derivative image has half
the field.  For even `k`, coprimality forces `n - k` to be odd, and the
Frobenius transport of `MCM/ComplementTransport.lean` preserves the cardinality of the
derivative image.
